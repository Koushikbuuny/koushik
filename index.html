         <h2>What is Climate Change?</h2>
         <p>Climate change refers to long-term shifts in temperatures and weather patterns, primarily caused by human activities. The burning of fossil fuels such as coal, oil, and gas releases greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide and methane into the atmosphere. These gases trap heat, leading to the warming of the planet.</p>

           <p>Over the past century, the Earth’s average temperature has increased significantly. This has led to more extreme weather events, rising sea levels, shrinking ice caps, and disruptions to ecosystems. Heatwaves, floods, and wildfires have become more frequent and intense, affecting millions of people worldwide.
            Addressing climate change requires global cooperation. Governments, industries, and individuals all play a role. Shifting to renewable energy sources, protecting forests, and promoting sustainable agriculture are vital steps. Additionally, reducing personal carbon footprints—by driving less, conserving energy, and minimizing waste—can make a difference.
            <ul>
                <li>The future of the planet depends on urgent and sustained action. By working together, we can slow the pace of climate change and build a more sustainable world for future generations.</li></ul>
